A competent cloud professional with an experienced background in both on premise and cloud (AWS, Azure) technologies, both Windows and Linux. I enjoy working within Agile Software Development environments, enabling product teams build and release software faster, building the tooling and infrastructure that they need, without impacting service quality, resilience or security.

Currently working as a TAM in the breach containment space.
